    <p style="font-size: 20px; color: whitesmoke; margin-top: 175px; margin-left: 400px; text-align: right; margin-right: 30px;">I have a versatile design skill set, utilizing various tools and technologies to create interactive and functional solutions. Using Unity, I developed a bus stand simulation, showcasing my ability to visualize and implement ideas in a virtual environment. With Tkinter and Turtle, I have designed engaging games and an intuitive user interface for a hospital database management system, blending functionality with user-friendly design. I am also proficient in HTML and CSS, which I have used to create responsive portfolios for myself and others. Additionally, I have expertise in SolidWorks, having designed a complete square post tool kit, including its assembly. My design skills reflect a blend of creativity, technical precision, and attention to detail.</p>
